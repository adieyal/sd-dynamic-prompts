0.1 Initial implementation
0.2 Fixed Batch img2img implementation
0.3 Added interval implementation for combinations, i.e. you can now use {1-2$$op1|opt2|opt3} which will choose one or two options. Thanks to @galvanized for this.
0.4 Rows in a wildcard file that contain dynamic syntax will be resolved. This enables recusive resolution. See [this](https://github.com/adieyal/sd-dynamic-prompting/issues/3) feature request for a use case
0.4.1 Fixed regular expression for wildcards, it previously didn't allow wildcard files with underscores in them.
0.4.2 Ignoring unknown characters in non-utf8 encoding wildcard files
0.4.3 Printing prompts at logger level INFO
0.4.4 Fixed bug where num_batches was being interpreted as num_images
0.4.5 Enabled generation of grids
0.5.0 The script can now handle nested wildcard directories in order to make it easier to organise large wildcard collections. Comments and empty lines are now ignored. Both features thanks to @evanjs 
0.6.0 Added path globbing for wildcards. Thanks for @evanjs for the idea and original implementation
0.7.0 Updated wildcard ui by @TheAwesomeGoat
